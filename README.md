## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to introduce participants to game development using Unity and C#, providing a solid foundation for creating interactive experiences.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop has participants follow along with hands-on activities, where they build simple scenes and learn how to use Unity's tools and C# scripting to bring their ideas to life. By the end, participants will have created their own small interactive project while gaining practical skills.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
Participants start by playing Little Smash Guys, a fast-paced 2-4 player battle royale game. The game emphasizes multiplayer interactions, strategic gameplay, and competitive fun. This section familiarizes participants with Unity's capabilities by showcasing mechanics, lively visuals, and engaging gameplay design. Beginners experience firsthand the elements of a completed game, such as player controls, physics interactions, and visual effects, setting the stage for the development process. After the gameplay session, participants transition into creating their own Unity game inspired by Flappy Bird. This hands-on portion introduces them to fundamental Unity concepts and tools.

* [Unity](https://Unity.com/games) is a versatile game engine for creating 2D, 3D, VR, and AR experiences across multiple platforms, using C# scripting and real-time rendering.
* Unity uses a visual interface combined with C# scripting, letting you design game worlds and mechanics by dragging and dropping objects and components while also writing custom code for detailed control—it's like crafting your own interactive universe!
* Unity was chosen because of its user-friendly interface and powerful tools, making it perfect for creating the game’s simple mechanics and minimalist design. Despite its simplicity, the game includes a slight challenge to engage players, which Unity’s versatility made easy to implement.
